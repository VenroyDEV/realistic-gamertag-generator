# realistic-gamertag-generator
+ Do you want to create an ALT or Botnet?, completely disconnected from your main account username?
+ Are you lazy or have to always manually create a realistic gamertag which seem to sound a bit off?
+ Are the browser name generators not realisitc enough for you? (example : "pizzamike5")

Then feel free to try out this name generator!
This file creates a GUI Interface but you can uncomment the #print command if you want to simply see everything in the Terminal (which is understandable).


**How do I run this file?**
+ Simply download the Program 
+ open the "Terminal" or "cmd"
+ go to the directoy where you the unzipped the Project  | __**(dir [windows] or ls [linux], to see files/directories) (cd [both linux & windows], to move to the selected directory)**__
+ Type "python3 realistic-gamertag-generator"
+ ENJOY!


I will add more names to the list!
